    <p>
        Kreuzberg is a district of Berlin, Germany. It is part of the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg borough located south of
        Mitte. During the Cold War era, it was one of the poorest areas of West Berlin, but since German reunification
        in 1990, it has become more gentrified and is known for its arts scene.
        The borough is known for its large percentage of immigrants and descendants of immigrants, many of whom are of
        Turkish ancestry. As of 2006, 31.6% of Kreuzberg's inhabitants did not have German citizenship. Kreuzberg is
        noted for its diverse cultural life and experimental alternative lifestyles, <a
            href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en/bezirke/friedrichshain-kreuzberg" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
        is an
        attractive area for many; however, some parts of the district are still characterized by higher levels of
        unemployment.
